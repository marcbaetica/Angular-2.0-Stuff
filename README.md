#Angular 2.0 Apps

Info:
-
This repo is used to track my learning progress with the upcoming AngularJS 2.0 framework. The frameowrk has undergone a drastic rebuild of its architecture and its use in an application has radically changed.

The Google owned github repository for this framework is located at:
https://github.com/angular/angular

Although I will attempt to npm-update the Angular package with every commit, please note that Angular 2.0's latest builds have still not matured and may cause certain aspects of my apps to crash. For obvious reasons I will be using Google's Chrome browser as a testing platform since it passes the sanity check at the time of writing this note.

If you happen to stumble upon this and have any suggestions or can reccomend some good blogs covering this topic feel free to email me at marc.baetica@gmail.com and I will be more than appreciative as an API documentation is yet to be made public prior to the official release.
